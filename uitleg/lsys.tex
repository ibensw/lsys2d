\begin{abstract}
L-systems are developed to easily represent complex iterative structures like plants, trees and fractals. This thesis describes the way I implemented a software package that can iterate and draw these structures using an optimized algorithm.

The program can handle both 2D and 3D L-systems and supports brackets, stochastic structures, colors and polygons. The input is an xml-file that the program will transform into a tree-based structure representing a specific iteration. Both a command line tool as a GUI are available. The drawing method uses OpenGL to efficiently draw the structures on screen.

This paper also explains why this program is more efficient than the naive approach to iterate these structures. Time and space complexities are calculated to prove the efficiency gain.

\section{What are L-Systems?}
L-systems or Lindenmayer systems are a way of visualizing any kind of abstract object. It is most often used for fractals and plants or flowers, but variants exist for DNA representation, bit errors in data streams and many more.

\subsection{Turtle Graphics}
Lindenmayer systems rely on turtle graphics as a drawing technique. It specifies a turtle or pen, which has a position, a direction and an specific angle $\sigma$. This pen can draw a line forward, move forward without drawing a line and turn left or right over $\sigma$. Drawing results in a line of length 1 and an updated position, where moving only results in the latter. Turning only results in an updated direction.
To control the pen, a set of commands is given as an input string, where each symbol represents a command.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c | l}
Symbol & Action \\ \hline
F & Draw forward \\
f & Move forward \\
+ & Turn left over $\sigma$ \\
- & Turn right over $\sigma$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

This way the string F+F+F+F and $\sigma = 90\degree$ would result in a square. A more complicated example is the Koch curve given in figure \ref{fig:koch}.
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[]{koch.png}
  \caption{Koch curve drawn using turtle graphics}
  \label{fig:koch}
\end{figure}

This figure is the representation of the following string:
\begin{verbatim}
F+F--F+F+F+F--F+F--F+F--F+F+F+F--F+F--F+F--F+F+F+F--F+F-
-F+F--F+F+F+F--F+F--F+F--F+F+F+F--F+F--F+F--F+F+F+F--F+F
\end{verbatim}

  \includegraphics[]{dragon.png}
  \caption{Dragon curve}
  \label{fig:dragon}
\end{figure}

L-Systems use formal grammar techniques to extend the possibilities of turtle graphics in a way fractals are easier to produce. 

An L-system consists of:
\begin{enumerate}
\item an alphabet $\mathcal{A}$, which represents all the possible symbols in the generated string;
\item a dictionary $\mathcal{B}$, that maps every symbol from $\mathcal{A}$ to an action for the turtle graphics;
\item an axiom, a string in $\mathcal{A}$ that represents iteration zero;
\item an angle $\sigma$, the default angle for turning;
\item a set of production rules $X \rightarrow Y$, where $X$ is a character in $\mathcal{A}$ and $Y$ a string in $\mathcal{A}$.
\end{enumerate}
\label{enum:definition}

Except for fractals, L-systems are very often used to generate plants and trees. The Koch curve in figure \ref{fig:koch} can be given as an L-system.

\begin{table}
\center
\begin{tabular}{l l}
Axiom & $F--F--F$ \\ \hline
$\sigma$ & 60\degree \\ \hline
Rules & $F \rightarrow F+F--F+F$ \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{The Koch-curve as an L-System}

\end{figure}

The power of an L-system is the way in which they generate strings using symmetries; fractals and flowers can be represented as very small files (usually under 1KB) but iterating them can produce complex images. To generate this complex images, the L-system must be iterated.
The axiom is iteration zero, it specifies the starting string. Iterating an L-system will replace every character in the string with the body of the respectively production rule. The second iteration will take the output of the first iteration and will replace these characters by their production bodies. For example, given an axiom $F--F--F$ and only one production rule $F \rightarrow F+F--F+F$ will produce the following output strings:
\begin{table}[h!]
\center
\begin{tabular}{l l}
Iteration & String \\ \hline \vspace{5pt}
0 \footnotesize (axiom) & $F--F--F$ \\ \vspace{5pt}
1 & $\underline{F+F--F+F}--\underline{F+F--F+F}--\underline{F+F--F+F}$ \\
2 & \footnotesize $\underline{\underline{F+F--F+F}+\underline{F+F--F+F}--\underline{F+F--F+F}+\underline{F+F--F+F}}--$ \\

\end{tabular}
\caption{Generating the Koch curve}
\end{table}

\subsection{Extensions}
Although this basic set of commands allows us to draw some nice pictures, many extensions have been added to maximize the possibilities of L-Systems. The implemented extensions are given in this subsection.

\subsubsection{Brackets}
Brackets are used to save the current state (at least the current position and direction) to a stack. This allows us to start a subexpression as a new branch, but return later on to the original position and continue its root branch.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c | l}
Symbol & Action \\ \hline
[ & Push the current state to the stack \\
] & Pop the last saved state from the stack \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{minipage}[c]{0.65\textwidth}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l l}
Axiom & $X$ \\ \hline
$\sigma$ & $22.5$\degree \\ \hline
Rules & $X \rightarrow F-[[X]+X]+F[+FX]-X$ \\
& $F \rightarrow FF$ \\
	\end{tabular}
  \end{minipage}
  \begin{minipage}[c]{0.33\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{tree.png}
  \end{minipage}
  \caption{Simple 2D plant with brackets}
  \label{fig:tree}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{3D}
To create more realistic models of objects, 3D was introduced. Instead of just turning left and right, it gives support for rotating the pen and adjusting its pitch.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c | l}
Symbol & Action \\ \hline
\& & Pitch down \\
\^{} & Pitch up \\
/ & Roll right \\
$\backslash$ & Roll left \\
$\vert$  & Turn 180\degree \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{minipage}[c]{0.65\textwidth}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l l}
Axiom & $F$ \\ \hline
$\sigma$ & $28$\degree \\ \hline
Rules & $F \rightarrow F[\&+F]F[-\backslash F][\&F]$
	\end{tabular}
  \end{minipage}
  \begin{minipage}[c]{0.25\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{3dtree.png}
  \end{minipage}
  \caption{A 3D plant}
  \label{fig:3dtree}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Polygons}
To improve the realism of the models even more, flowers and leaves can be added to them. Therefore the drawing system should support polygons. The start of a polygon implies storing the position on the stack. When a polygon is started, every position where the pen moves to will create a new triangle. This triangle is defined by three corners: the new position, the previous position, and the starting position of the polygon. Obviously, after the first movement the starting position and the previous position are the same so no triangle can be created. To support this settings, the state of the pen must be extended with a polygon flag, which must be set when a new polygon is started.
Figure \ref{fig:polygon} is the visualization of the following string ($\sigma = 30\degree$):
\begin{verbatim}
F{-f+f+f-|-f+f+f}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{polygons.pdf}
  \caption{How a polygon is drawn}
  \label{fig:polygon}
\end{figure}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c | l}
Symbol & Action \\ \hline
\{ & Push the current state to the stack and set polygon mode \\
\} & Pop the last saved state from the stack \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Pen style}
Another extension is the pen style, this includes both line length and thickness as the color. On default, an L-System starts with a line length of 1 and 10\% of the length as thickness. This allows us to draw a thick trunk and smaller branches, or brown trees with green leaves. The pen style is also part of the state, so it will get saved whenever we push the stack.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c | l}
Symbol & Action \\ \hline
! & Reduce thickness by 20\% \\
? & Increase thickness by 20\% \\
' & Reduce length by 10\% \\
" & Increase length by 10\% \\
c & Increase color index by 1
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The default values (10\% and 20\%) are just guidelines which can be modified per action, this will be explained in section \ref{parameters}.


\subsubsection{Parameters}
\label{parameters}
The last implemented extension is the ability to give each command an optional parameter which is specified between brackets after the command it applies to. Using parameters makes it possible to turn over an angle, other than $\sigma$, or specify a fixed color constant.

\end{center}

\subsection{Efficiency} % both time and space approach and complexity
Implementing a program to calculate and draw Lindenmayer systems is not a big challenge. There is a very naive way of doing this, which will be explained later on, but this method is in general very slow and consumes huge amounts of memory. We will try to speed things up by implementing a more complex data structure and using some general optimizations. The approach of this project was to minimize both the time and space complexity.

\newpage
\section{Implementation}

As seen in section \ref{enum:definition}, a Lindenmayer system is defined by several parameters. In a datastructure, these could be implemented as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The alphabet, which could just be the machines character set; \label{structalpha}
\item The axiom as a string; \label{structaxiom}
\item The list of production rules as a list with pairs (character, string) as elements; \label{structrules}
\item The default angle $\sigma$, a floating point for the radial or degree representation;
\item The dictionary, usually an array or vector;
\item Optionally a set of colors.
\end{enumerate}
Only \ref{structalpha}, \ref{structaxiom} and \ref{structrules} are required for the string production. And since the alphabet is usually the machines character set, there is no need to store this in the program.

\subsection{String iteration, the naive approach}

Iterating L-systems is not very difficult using string iteration. Your program only needs the production rules and the axiom, no preprocessing is required. From the previous step or axiom, the program loops over every character and adds the substitution of that character to the new string or the character itself if no production rule is found.

\lstset{label=code:stringit,caption=String iteration}
\begin{lstlisting}
//Given: axiom (string), rules (array of string)
currentstring = axiom
iteration = 0

function iterate()
	newstring = ""
	iteration = iteration + 1
	foreach c in currentstring
		if (c in rules)
			newstring = newstring + rules[c]
		else
			newstring = newstring + c
	currentstring = newstring
\end{lstlisting}

The code in Listing \ref{code:stringit} shows the algorithm to iterate currentstring to the next iteration. This is a fairly easy implementation of both the algorithm and the datastructure, but it has some huge disadvantages: iterating the L-system found in Figure \ref{fig:3dtree} just 12 times returns a string of size 915527344 ($\pm$ 873 MB). Besides the memory usage, it took over 30 minutes to process the last 3 iterations. Another small disadvantage is the fact that you cannot undo one iteration without recalculating the string from the start.

Since the complexity differs for every L-system, the specific time and space complexities for the Sierpinski triangle are demonstrated below. A generalisation is given afterwards.

\begin{table}
\center
\begin{tabular}{l l}
Axiom & $A$ \\ \hline
$\sigma$ & 90\degree \\ \hline
Rules & $A \rightarrow B-A-B$ \\
      & $B \rightarrow A+B+A$ \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{The L-system of the Sierpinski triangle} \label{tbl:siertri}
\end{table}

The Sierpinski triangle is described in Table \ref{tbl:siertri}. It contains 2 replacement rules that both contain 3 variables and have a total substring length of 5.

\subsubsection{Space complexity of the Sierpinski triangle}

The naive approach stores the string as a character string in the memory so its space complexity is $O(s)$, where $s$ is the lenght of the string. $s$ can be rewritten as $V+T$, whereas $V$ represents the number of variables and $T$ the number of terminals. At each iteration, every variable is replaced by 3 new variables and 2 terminal symbols. So $V(I) = 3^I$ and $T(I) = T(I-1) + 2 * V(I-1) = T(I-1)*3 + 2$ from where we can show that $T(I) = 3^I-1$. Both $V$ and $T$ have complexity $O(3^I)$ so the space complexity of the Sierpinski triangle in the naive approach is $O(3^I)$.

\subsubsection{Time complexity of the Sierpinski triangle}

The time complexity to build the string representing $I$ iterations is $O(I * it)$, where $it$ is the time complexity of the function $iterate$. This function will replace every variable by a substring, so the complexity is linear with the number of variables in the $currentstring$ ($V=3^I$). The total time complexity becomes $O(I * 3^I)$ which equals $O(3^I)$. The traversal happens with direct access so it is $O(s)=O(3^I)$. This means both space and time complexity of the Sierpinski tiangle as an L-system are non-polynomial ($O(3^I)$).

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{triangle.png}
  \caption{Sierpinski triangle}
  \label{fig:triangle}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Complexities for a general case}

In general, let $I$ be the iteration level, $n$ the maximum production body length and $p$ the maximum number of replacement symbols in a production body.
The space complexity is polynomial and bound by $n^I$ (where every character is a variable). The time complexity to build a general structure is $O(p^I)$. When it is build, the time needed to request one character is $O(1)$, since an array allows direct memory access. This brings the total complexity to build the structure and traverse it once at $O(p^I) + (n^I)*O(1) = O(p^I+n^I)$.
Both time and space complexity are non-polynomial, so we will try to improve this.

\subsection{A more efficient data structure} %and maybe the draw inside the calc

The only production rule in Figure \ref{fig:3dtree} is $F \rightarrow F[\&+F]F[-\backslash F][\&F]$. So every F in the axiom will be replaced by the same string. The next iteration should only iterate that string once, and it will be correct for every occurence of F in the original string. This will speed up the iteration time and decrease the memory usage of the string representation drastically.


\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{struct.pdf}
  \caption{A tree based datastructure that represents the Sierpinske triangle at level 2}
  \label{fig:struct}
\end{figure}

The string will be stored as a tree-like datastructure similar to the one in Figure \ref{fig:struct}, with the axiom as the root node. Each node consists of 2 arrays of equal size: a character array, which is just the string representation of the node, and an array of pointers, where each pointer points to the replacement node of the character at the next iteration level. If the character is a terminal (there exists no production body for this), its pointer will be null. If the iteration level is the last one calculated, the whole array will be null.

To prevent node duplication, one object manages the creation and deletion of all nodes. This object must assure that no duplicates will be created for a node in a specified iteration level.

To optimize a search for a specific index in the structure, another array is stored in each node. At each position of the node's string, the array represents the total length of the string with all subnodes expanded. 
In a leaf node, where no subnodes can be expanded, this array will just be a sequence from 1 to the length of the node's substring. To find a character at a specific index in this node, a binary search can be performed at this array to find the index of the character. In other nodes, a binary string will result in the index of the replacement character; the binary search can then be performed in the replacement node of this character.

Every level must be visited to find the character of a corresponding index. So when production bodies are small and the iteration level is high, this search technique had a high cost. We can eliminate some of these searches by using a buffer in each node. This buffer will contain the string with every subnode expanded so the search technique can find the character with direct access. The buffer will not be used if the expanded string is longer than the buffer size.

A small buffer will not reduce the number of steps needed to find a character this much, but a big one will store much more data in every node, so the buffer size must be chosen carefully.

When drawing the string, it will be read from front to back, and for each character the tree must be traversed. Since most characters will be found in the same node as the previous request (especially when using buffers), it is useful to store some information about the last path. When requesting a character, the node that holds the character stores its position in a certain directpath pointer, and stores the number of characters left in the buffer or in the same node. This information can be used as a direct path instead of traversing the whole tree.

\subsubsection{Space complexity of the Sierpinski triangle}
The Sierpinske triangle has replacement rules, at every iteration level, each replacement rule will occur maximum once. A node's size is only linear dependend on the lenght of its representing string, which is always $O(5)$ in this case. Since the example only has 2 replacement rules, the structure's space complexity is $O(I*2*5)=O(I)$, representing every node at every level.

\subsubsection{Time complexity of the Sierpinski triangle}
As well as the space complexity, the time complexity improves a lot using this new datastructure. Building the structure must only create 1 node at each level, this brings down the complexity to $O(I*2)=O(I)$. Requesting a character from the structure needs a binary search at every iteration level which makes the time complexity $O(I*log(5))$. The traversal of the structure without using a buffer must do a binary search at every level for every character, which is $O(3^I * I*log(5))=O(3^I * I)$. We reduced one power from the naive approach, and introducing a buffer of size $b$ will reduce this cost even further to $O(3^I * (\frac{1}{b}*I + \frac{b-1}{b}))$.

\subsubsection{Complexities for a general case}
Some L-systems are too complex to calculate the exact complexity. So a general worst case complexity can be given that holds for every L-system.
Let $r$ be the number of production rules, than the worst case time complexity to build the structure is $O(I*r)$.
Requesting one character in the structure will take $O(I*log(n))$ time, but the traversal with a buffer will take only $O(n^I * (\frac{1}{b} * I*log(n) + (\frac{b-1}{b}))$ time. This makes a total time cost of $O(I*r + n^I * (\frac{1}{b} * I*log(n) + (\frac{b-1}{b}))$. The traversal is slightly worse than the naive approach but only for $1/b$ of the characters.
The space complexity for this structure is $O(I*r*n)$, which is the number of iteration levels with at each level a node of size $n$ for all $r$ production.

\subsection{Real life differences} %benchmark results

The benchmark results (Table \ref{bench}) depend on the implementation details of the programs. The time column represents both the building of the structure, traversal and the geometry calculation. The time was the average of 5 runs. 0 (not iterating) is included to give an impression of the preprocessing time and space. The memory is measured by iterating the system so only the structure is build, but without drawing the structure. N/A means the program crashes after about 40 seconds because the machine ran out of memory. The testmachine had 4GB of (virtual) memory with more than 3GB available.

  \caption{Memory usage for naieve approach (solid line) versus tree based structure (dotted line)}
  \label{fig:bench}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Calculating geometry}

When the string structure is built, the geometry of eacht object must be calculated. For this, the string must be traversed from the beginning to the end, and for every character a transformation must be made. The shorter the string, the less processing time, so we can use compression techniques that do not make the string harder to process. Run-length encoding (RLE) is an example of a string compression technique that keeps the string easily processable. For example, the RLE algorithm will compress the string $+++++//////$ to $+`5/`6$. Instead of just shortening the string, the processor will read $+`5$ as $+(\sigma*5)$ and that will take up only one action. Furthermore, the LRE algorithm can be modified to compress strings like $+--++++$ to $+`3$ and $+++--+--$ to an empty string.
Another scenario that will slow down the processing speed are L-systems that contain production bodies with parameters. For example the production rule $X \rightarrow F(0.3333)+F(0.3333)--F(0.3333)+F(0.3333)$. Each time an F is encountered, the following character will be tested for the presence of a parameter. When the test is positive, it must process the tail string to a double. This process is quite expensive and can be eliminated using an inlined parameter reference. This means every production body and the axiom will be preprocessed to inline the parameters. In this inline process, every parameter encountered will be pushed in a vector and a reference to the vector index will replace the parameter in the string. The production body of a given example after preprocessing might look like $F\tilde{ } 1+F\tilde{ } 1-`2F\tilde{ } 1+F\tilde{ } 1$ and a vector $p[1]=0.3333$. Not only is this rewritten body shorter so it needs less storage space, it will also be processed faster, since the parameter (0.3333) does not have to be converted from string to double whenever it is encountered.

\begin{table}
\center
\begin{tabular}{l r r r r}
File 			& iterations	& NO time	& O time	& relative speedup\\ \hline
dragoncurve.xml	& 25			& 12.315 s	& 12.158 s	&  1.27 \% \\ \hline
tree.xml		& 8				&  3.205 s	&  2.520 s	& 21.37 \% \\ \hline
plant6.xml		& 12			&  3.335 s	&  2.450 s	& 26.54 \% \\ \hline
snowflake.xml	& 10			&  1.240 s	&  1.020 s	& 17.74 \% \\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\caption{Geometry optimization. NO time = non-optimized time; O time = optimized time} \label{benchopt}
\end{table}

Table \ref{benchopt} shows how these optimization techniques speed up the processing time of the string from nearly 0 to over 25 \%.
